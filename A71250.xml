            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of your <hi>Preface</hi> ſeems reducible to theſe two <hi>Points,</hi> viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Controverſy</hi> between the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>general.</hi> And,</item>
               <item>II. Of the <hi>Diſputes</hi> that have heretofore been, and are at this day managed againſt you, by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>particular.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <q>2. Ad pag. 1.] The <hi>former</hi> of theſe you introduce with a ſhort harangue of <q rend="inline">the Miſchief which <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> bring along with them, not only to the individual Perſons that are guilty of them, but alſo to the Nations in which they are propagated.</q> You repreſent to us <q rend="inline">the miſerable Broils, and other worſe Conſequences that have attended theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Religion in this and the laſt Age:</q> And from thence you conclude, <q rend="inline">how much they are to be commended who labour to eſtabliſh Truth and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and thoſe to be condemned, who ſeek all means poſſible to obſcure the one and obſtruct the other.</q>
            </q>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Anſw.]</hi> To all which I have only this to <hi>reply;</hi> that we need no Arguments to convince us of theſe things. There are none more ſenſible of the <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> than we are; or that do more truly lament the Diviſions that are in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56987:9"/> the <hi>Church,</hi> or would more heartily contribute, what in us lies, to the <hi>cloſing</hi> of them. But then as we have good cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve both from the Authority of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and from the Nature of Mankind, that whilſt there is a Devil in Hell, and Men of Intereſt and Deſigns upon Earth, there ſhall alſo be <hi>Hereſies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. xi. 19.</note> that <hi>they who are approved may be made manifeſt:</hi> So we cannot but complain that thoſe ſhould be the moſt forward to charge us both with the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Miſchief</hi> of them, at whoſe doors the <hi>Crime,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Evil</hi> Conſequences of it, will one day be found to lie. The <hi>former</hi> of theſe, it will be the buſineſs of the following Diſcourſe to make good: And for the <hi>latter,</hi> whoſoever ſhall impartially conſider the <hi>Origen</hi> of thoſe Broils with which the World has, you ſay, been agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>in this and the laſt Age upon the account of Religion;</hi> not to mention thoſe other <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> of <hi>Treaſons, Plots, Maſſacres, Perſecutions,</hi> and the like, will ſoon be convinced who they are that have cauſe to complain of <hi>theſe Evils.</hi> For what you add,
<q>4. Ibid.] <q rend="inline">That they who will but impartially conſider mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will find that <hi>Catholicks</hi> have upon all occaſions ſought the moſt <hi>Advantageous Means</hi> to procure this <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Peace;</hi> tho to their grief they have ſtill been hindred from effecting this Good Work.</q>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.]</hi> I do not well know what you deſign by it. If by <hi>the moſt Advantageous Means,</hi> you underſtand thoſe <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> which God has given us whereby to come to diſcern the Truth of Religion; ſuch as, 1. <hi>A diligent reading of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>uſing</hi> of all imaginable <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> for the underſtanding <hi>the ſenſe of them,</hi> by ſtudying the <hi>Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> in which they were written, <hi>ſearching of Antiquity, colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting parallel places,</hi> and the like. 2. The <hi>diveſting</hi> of our ſelves of our <hi>Prejudices,</hi> and forming in our Minds an <hi>impartial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> to <hi>find out</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> with an honeſt <hi>readineſs</hi> to <hi>embrace it,</hi> on what ſide ſoever it lies. And laſtly, to all this add our earneſt <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for his Grace to bleſs and proſper our Endeavours; theſe I confeſs are the beſt <hi>Means</hi> to diſcover <hi>Chriſtian Truth;</hi> and to exhort all others to the uſe of them, the moſt <hi>advantageous way</hi> to promote it. But then I cannot imagine why you ſhould ſeem to appropriate <hi>theſe Means</hi> to your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56987:9"/> ſelves, as if you only ſought <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> by them; ſeeing it cannot be deny'd but that <hi>We</hi> have employ'd all theſe with as great diligence as <hi>you can</hi> pretend to have done it. But now ſome <hi>other Means</hi> indeed there are, which you have purſu'd, and which it may be you underſtand by this Expreſſion: and then We neither <hi>deny</hi> your <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> nor <hi>envy</hi> you the <hi>Glory</hi> of being ſingular in your Endeavours of procuring Peace by them. Such are, 1. The <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence;</hi> your <hi>Holy Leagues,</hi> and <hi>private Treacheries,</hi> your <hi>Inquiſitions, Plots, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,</hi> and ſuch like. 2. The <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> your <hi>falſe Expoſitions</hi> and <hi>Miſrepreſentations</hi> of your Doctrine to deceive the ignorant and unwary, till you get them into your Nets. 3. The <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs,</hi> your bold <hi>Anathema's</hi> and <hi>vain thundrings</hi> of <hi>Damnation</hi> againſt all that differ from you, your aſſuming the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> to your <hi>ſingle Communion,</hi> and excluding all others out of it, as <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And laſtly, to mention no more, the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>groſs Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> by depriving Men of their liberty of <hi>reading</hi> the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> by keeping your <hi>Service</hi> in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to depend intirely upon your <hi>Churches Dictates,</hi> and not to depart from them, tho <hi>Senſe, Reaſon, Scripture, all</hi> be contrary to them. Theſe are, I confeſs, ſome of thoſe <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Means</hi> whereby you have ſought to procure <hi>Chriſtian Peace;</hi> and Experience tells you, that they are indeed the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous of any to the <hi>Cauſe</hi> you have to defend. And if theſe be the <hi>Means</hi> which you ſay we have <hi>oppoſed,</hi> I hope we ſhall always continue ſo to do, and rather bear all the <hi>Evils</hi> of theſe Diviſions, than either <hi>buy Peace</hi> upon <hi>ſuch Terms,</hi> or <hi>purſue it</hi> by <hi>ſuch Means</hi> as theſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Ad p. 2, 3.] To what I obſerved from the late <hi>Methods</hi> that had been taken up in our <hi>Neighbour Country</hi> to avoid the entring upon <hi>particular Diſputes,</hi> which I ſaid you were ſenſible had been the leaſt favourable of any to your <hi>Cauſe,</hi> you reply, "<hi>That you have never declined fighting with us at any Weapon:</hi> which how true it is, the account before given of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the <hi>preſent Controverſie</hi> with us ſufficiently declares. And indeed you ſeem in ſome ſort to have been <hi>ſenſible</hi> of it; and therefore recur to your <hi>Antient Authors</hi> for proof of your <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> The <hi>Sum</hi> of what you ſay is this:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56987:10"/>
               <q>6. Reply.] <q rend="inline">That there have been <hi>three</hi> ſorts of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſince the <hi>Reformation; 1.</hi> Some who appealed to <hi>Scripture only,</hi> neither would they admit of <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> nor <hi>Councils. 2.</hi> Others who perceived that they could not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeveral Tenets and Practices of their own by the bare words of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and deſpairing of Fathers and Councils of latter Ages, pretended at leaſt to admit of the <hi>firſt four General Councils,</hi> and of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the firſt three or four hundred Years. <hi>3.</hi> Others finally who ventured to name <hi>Tradition</hi> as a uſeful Means to arrive at the true Faith.</q> And all theſe you ſay you have convinced of their Errors.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Anſw.]</hi> It has always been your way to multiply <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> among <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as much as ever you were able, and then to complain againſt us upon the account of them; and here you have given us a notable Inſtance of it. The <hi>three Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> you have drawn out as ſo many different Parties amongſt us, do all reſolve into the very ſame Principle: <q rend="inline">That the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture</hi> is the only, perfect, and ſufficient Rule of Faith:</q> So that all other Authorities, whether of <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Councils,</hi> or <hi>unwritten Tradition,</hi> are to be examined by it, and no farther to be admitted by us than they agree with it. This is in effect the common belief of all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> whatſoever, as appears from their ſeveral <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and might eaſily be ſhewn out of the Writings of our <hi>firſt Reformers,</hi> and the moſt eminent of thoſe who have lived ſince, and built their Faith upon the ſame Foundation. It is true indeed, there have been ſome who, the better to maintain their <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> have from this ſound <hi>Principle, That nothing is to be received by us as a Matter of Faith, but what is either plainly expreſſed</hi> in the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or can <hi>evidently be proved by it,</hi> drawn a very <hi>ill Conſequence,</hi> viz. <hi>That nothing might lawfully be done or uſed in the Worſhip of God, unleſs there were ſome Command or Example for it in Scripture;</hi> and have by this means run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into great Inconveniences. But the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which an uninterrupted <hi>Tradition,</hi> by the common conſent of all Parties of Chriſtians, however otherwiſe diſagreeing in other Points, has brought down to us, and delivered into our hands as the <hi>Word of God,</hi> this has among <hi>all Proteſtants</hi> been ever the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56987:10"/> ſame, <hi>viz. The Holy Scripture.</hi> And if for the farther proof of the Truth of our Doctrine, we have at any time put the iſſue of our Cauſe to the deciſion of the <hi>Church of the firſt three or four hundred Years,</hi> it is not becauſe we ſuppoſe that thoſe <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> who then lived, have any more right to judg us, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Faith, than thoſe that follow'd after; but becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination we find them to have yet continued (at leaſt as to the <hi>common Belief</hi> received and eſtabliſh'd amongſt them) in their <hi>Purity;</hi> and that what was generally eſtabliſh'd and practiſed by them, was indeed conformable both to <hi>their</hi> and <hi>our Rule,</hi> the <hi>Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. This then is our <hi>Common Principle,</hi> and this you cannot deny to be moſt reaſonable. For whatſoever <hi>Authority</hi> you would have us give to thoſe <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> yet it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that,</p>

            <p>Eſpecially if we conſider, 2dly, That we are expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid in Holy Scripture, to rely on any Perſons whatſoever without enquiry, whether what they teach be true or not: <q rend="inline"> Dearly Beloved, (<hi>ſays St.</hi> John) believe not every Spirit,<note place="margin">1 John 4.1.</note> but try the Spirits whether they be of God or no.</q> The ſame is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, <hi>To prove all things, and then hold faſt that which is good:</hi>

            <p>Nay but, 3dly, theſe <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> were not only capable of <hi>Erring,</hi> but in many things they actually did <hi>Err,</hi> and are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by you upon that account.

Now, not to inſiſt upon the Authority of <hi>Bede,</hi> who in ſeveral parts of his Works, plainly ſhews how little he believed your Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> this is undeniably evident from the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Homily</hi> tranſlated by <hi>Aelfrick,</hi> and appointed in the <hi>Saxons</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56987:16"/> time to be read to the People at <hi>Eaſter</hi> before they received the <hi>Holy Communion;</hi> and which is from one end to the other directly oppoſite to the Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> as eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by your <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Aelfrick</hi> in his Letters to <hi>Wulfine Biſhop of Scyrburne,</hi> and to <hi>Wulfstane Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of York,</hi> ſhews his own Notions to have been exactly correſpondent to what that <hi>Homily</hi> taught. <q rend="inline">The Houſell <hi>(ſays he)</hi> is Chriſtes <hi>Bodye</hi> not <hi>bodelye,</hi> but <hi>ghoſtlye.</hi> Not the <hi>Bodye which he ſuffred in,</hi> but the <hi>Bodye</hi> of which he ſpake when he bleſſed <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wyne</hi> to Houſell a night before his ſuffring, and ſaid by the <hi>bleſſed Bread,</hi> Thys is my <hi>Bodye,</hi> and agayne by the <hi>holy Wyne,</hi> This is my <hi>Bloud</hi> which is ſhedd for manye in forgiveneſs of Sins. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand nowe that the <hi>Lord</hi> who could turn that <hi>Bread</hi> before his ſuffering to his <hi>Bodye,</hi> and that <hi>Wyne</hi> to his <hi>Bloude ghoſtlye,</hi> that the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame <hi>Lorde</hi> bleſſeth dayly through the Prieſtes handes Bread and Wyne to his <hi>ghoſtlye Bodye</hi> and to his <hi>ghoſtlye Bloud.</hi>

            <p n="73">73.

As to the <hi>Conſcientious Converts,</hi> (allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their <hi>Capacities,</hi> and that they are able to overcome all the foremention'd Difficulties, and to diſcover the Cheat, which I fear is what the much greateſt part of theſe are not able to do): It is indeed hard to ſay what a <hi>terrible Conflict</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56987:28"/> this will be apt to make in them. But yet the Point of <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the <hi>Opinion of the World, ſhame of Return,</hi> and the <hi>dangers</hi> thoſe commonly run who venture to <hi>reveal ſuch Sacred Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> theſe Conſiderations have ſometimes kept <hi>good Men</hi> a longer time in ſuſpenſe, than any of your <hi>Proſelytes</hi> have yet had to reſolve upon a <hi>return</hi> to us.

            <p n="74">74. Again: We know there have been many in your <hi>Church,</hi> who though they have <hi>diſcover'd</hi> theſe <hi>Prevarications,</hi> yet have thought, that as long as they did not themſelves <hi>join</hi> in your <hi>Errors,</hi> they might hold their Tongues, and live quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an <hi>External Communion</hi> with you: and their Eyes have been ſo dazled with the <hi>Splendor, Succeſſion, Extent,</hi> &amp;c. of your <hi>Church,</hi> that they have preferr'd it with all <hi>its Faults</hi> to Others who ſeem to them to want theſe <hi>Advantages.</hi> Such were the famous <hi>George Caſſander,</hi> Father <hi>Barnes,</hi> and others that I might mention. Nay, it is no very long time, ſince a Perſon yet living, <hi>Monſieur Ferrand,</hi> has publiſh'd a Book to ſhew, that were the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as <hi>corrupt</hi> as we <hi>pretend</hi> it to be, yet we ought not nevertheleſs to <hi>ſeparate from it.</hi> And ſhould any of your <hi>Converts</hi> be of this <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> they may ſtill continue to all appearance in your <hi>Church,</hi> though they ſee the <hi>Errors,</hi> and your <hi>falſifications</hi> of the <hi>true Doctrine</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="75">75. But, 3dly, though I do affirm that what you publiſh is not the <hi>Ancient Doctrine</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> yet I do not deny but it is that which you endeavour to make paſs with your <hi>Converts</hi> as ſuch. This you teach your <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> the <hi>Biſhop of Meaux</hi> his <hi>Dioceſs;</hi> and they rarely meet with any one that maintains the <hi>contrary.</hi> But this do's not hinder, that becauſe this is the <hi>Popery</hi> of a few Engliſh <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> and <hi>French Expoſitors;</hi> that therefore it has been all along the <hi>Common Doctrine</hi> of your <hi>Church;</hi> or is conformable to the practice of other Countries at this day. And all Men have not the leiſure to go into <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain;</hi> or the ability to read over your <hi>ſeveral Authors</hi> for ſatisfaction in it.</p>
            <p n="76">76. But, 4thly, to quit all theſe <hi>Suppoſitions;</hi> yet ſince you make it no leſs than a <hi>Mortal Sin</hi> to have any <hi>Doubts</hi> of your <hi>Religion;</hi> you are ſure, as ſoon as any ſuch ariſe in their Minds to hear of it in <hi>Confeſſion</hi> from them.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56987:28"/> ways imaginable to <hi>ſtifle them,</hi> and hinder them from coming to an <hi>open defection</hi> from you. So that though your <hi>Proſelyte</hi> ſhould begin to ſtagger; yet unleſs he utterly abandon your Party without ever conſulting you in it, (which <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> will never do) he is almoſt under an <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of ever doing it at all.</p>
            <p n="77">77. To all which I will add but this farther: Which well may, and I am perſwaded do's keep many from <hi>telling of Tales,</hi> and expoſing (as you call it) your <hi>Villany;</hi> and that is, that when you receive a <hi>new Convert</hi> into your <hi>Church,</hi> you require a <hi>terrible Oath</hi> from him, never by <hi>any Argument</hi> to <hi>leave</hi> or to <hi>forſake</hi> you, upon pain of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> if he do's.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56987:30"/> new Attempt one jot beyond what I had before confuted, but that in all their <hi>Books,</hi> their whole Buſineſs is meerly to <hi>tranſcribe one another;</hi> ſo that from the<note n="†" place="margin">See the Reply, Preſ. <hi>p. vi.</hi>

Nor will I diſpute with you, laſtly, Whether the <hi>Saints</hi> in Happineſs do not in General pray for the <hi>Church Militant:</hi> For 'tis to as little purpoſe to deny what cannot be diſproved, as to affirm what one cannot prove. I have as great an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as any Man for Mr. <hi>Thorndyke</hi>'s Memory; but yet I cannot ſee the Proof even of this in thoſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> which (as you ſay) He <hi>proves</hi> it by.<note place="margin">Reply, P. 11.</note> Some <hi>Fathers</hi> I know have ſaid ſo; but their ſaying it is not to Me a ſufficient Proof of a <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> When all is done, the <hi>Congruity</hi> of the thing is the <hi>beſt</hi> that can be brought for it.

I am likewiſe aſſured that his <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede</hi> for us is founded upon the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his <hi>Death.</hi> And ſince the <hi>Goſpel</hi> gives this <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> to <hi>Him ONLY, to appear in the Preſence of God for us,</hi> I ſhall never whilſt I live help forward an Ambiguity in thoſe <hi>Titles,</hi> of a <hi>Mediator with God,</hi> or an <hi>Advocate with the Father,</hi> or an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor in Heaven,</hi> by attributing of them to any <hi>Saint</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Theſe <hi>Expreſſions</hi> ſo applied are <hi>dangerous,</hi> and <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous;</hi> and 'tis but a frivolous Pretence for the doing of it, that poſſibly the <hi>Saints</hi> may do ſomething for us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> upon the account of which the <hi>Titles</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> may in <hi>ſome ſenſe</hi> be given to them.</p>

And I ſhall now offer ſome Reaſons, that may perhaps <hi>convince others,</hi> as they have fully <hi>ſatisfied my ſelf</hi> about it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. For 1. If the Nature of that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Invoking</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> be the ſame with that of deſiring my <hi>Chriſtian Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to pray for me upon <hi>Earth,</hi> then on the other hand this is alſo of the <hi>ſame Nature</hi> with that. And by conſequence, I may as well fall down upon my Knees here in <hi>London,</hi> and deſire my Chriſtian Brother, who is now, it may be, in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> or ſomewhere in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> or perhaps on his <hi>return homewards,</hi> to <hi>pray for me,</hi> as do the like to S. <hi>Peter</hi> or S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who, for any thing I can tell, are at a vaſtly greater diſtance from me, than my <hi>Friend</hi> upon <hi>Earth</hi> is. But if there be ſomething more than a <hi>Spirit of Charity,</hi> or an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> in <hi>calling</hi> upon my <hi>living friend,</hi> who is out of all <hi>natural diſtance</hi> of <hi>hearing,</hi> there is alſo ſomething
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56987:41"/> more than this in <hi>calling</hi> upon the <hi>dead,</hi> who it may be are a thouſand times farther from me, than the living can be from one another. Would not ſuch an <hi>Invocation</hi> of my <hi>Friend,</hi> think you, ſuppoſe him to be more than a <hi>Brother,</hi> or a <hi>Man?</hi> Would not the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Act</hi> aſcribe to him not only the praiſe of <hi>Charity,</hi> but likewiſe the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> all that is ſaid upon Earth, at any diſtance whatſoever? I grant, that if this were indeed no more than according to the Order of <hi>Fraternal Society;</hi> neither would it be any more than ſo for you to call upon the <hi>Saints deceaſed</hi> to pray for you. But if the <hi>former</hi> would be more, when you have ſaid all that you can, the latter muſt neceſſarily be ſo too: And you do thereby <hi>Elevate</hi> the <hi>Saints above the condition of Creatures.</hi> For whether you believe them to be <hi>Omnipreſent</hi> or not, the very <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking</hi> them indifferently in <hi>any place,</hi> and their being called upon in <hi>ſeveral places</hi> at the ſame time, does imply their <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence,</hi> unleſs you could give us ſome other ground of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that they hear you, beſides this, that wherever <hi>they are</hi> when they are <hi>ſpoken</hi> to, and wherever <hi>you are</hi> when <hi>you ſpeak</hi> to them, 'tis all one, they do as ſurely know what you ſay, as if they ſtood within the <hi>common diſtance of hearing.</hi> Now that <hi>Action,</hi> which in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of it aſcribes an <hi>Immenſity</hi> of <hi>preſence</hi> to the <hi>Object,</hi> about which it is converſant, is <hi>religious</hi> in the <hi>very Nature</hi> of the <hi>Act.</hi> And then I leave it to you to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether it be <hi>Idolatrous</hi> or not, if it be paid to any thing that is not <hi>God.</hi> But,</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you are not yet ſatisfied, I would deſire to know, whether <hi>prayer</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> which you will not deny to be in its <hi>own Nature</hi> a <hi>religious Act,</hi> be not ſo upon this account as well as others, that 'tis an <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of his <hi>Immenſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> But how is it ſuch an acknowledgment, otherwiſe than as we do in <hi>all places,</hi> and at <hi>all times call</hi> upon him.

This is an <hi>Argument</hi> that has been often enough urged to be taken notice of; and if you ſhall ſtill go on to ſay nothing to it, we ſhall conclude the reaſon to be, that indeed you have nothing to <hi>object</hi> againſt it.</p>

It is <hi>unreaſonable</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to thoſe as <hi>Saints,</hi> who, it may be, are not in <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor ever ſhall be there: But this is very probably the <hi>Caſe</hi> of many of your <hi>Saints,</hi> and you cannot be ſure it is otherwiſe, when you addreſs to them; and therefore it is <hi>unreaſonable</hi> in you to <hi>pray</hi> to them. 3. To pray to thoſe who never were in the World, is the moſt <hi>unreaſonable</hi> thing that can be imagined; but in your <hi>Prayers</hi> to many of your <hi>Saints,</hi> you addreſs to thoſe that never were in the World; and therefore upon this, and upon all the foregoing Accounts, I conclude it very <hi>unreaſonable</hi> to pray to the <hi>Saints</hi> at all.</p>

                  <p n="29">29. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tho there be then ſuch a diverſity of <hi>Opinions</hi> amongſt you as to this <hi>Worſhip;</hi> yet it is to be remarked that they who have allow'd the leaſt <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Capiſucchi, Ib. pag. 605.</note> have yet ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that <hi>ſome Honour</hi> was due to them. <q rend="inline">In this (<hi>ſays</hi> Capiſucchi) all <hi>Catholicks</hi> do agree that <hi>Images</hi> are to be <hi>worſhipped,</hi> and are rightly <hi>worſhipped</hi> by the faithful.

                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may from hence farther appear, that the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> which this <hi>Cardinal</hi> thought due to <hi>Images,</hi> was not an <hi>improper, accidental, abuſive Worſhip,</hi> but a <hi>true, proper,</hi> and <hi>real Adoration;</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> being to be <hi>adored</hi> in the very <hi>ſame act</hi> with which the <hi>Exemplar</hi> was.

                  <p n="31">31. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are to look upon, not as a <hi>private opinion,</hi> or a meer <hi>Scholaſtick Nicety,</hi> but as the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to be <hi>held of all.</hi> So the <hi>Cardinal</hi> expreſly declares, as being the Doctrine of the Councils both of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Trent;</hi> and for denying of which, <hi>Aegidius Magiſtralis</hi> was by the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> forced to <hi>recant,</hi> and renounce his Doctrine contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as <hi>Heretical.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1ſt, As to the Book which you cite for this goodly <hi>Story,</hi> 'tis certain it was written above 420 years after <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was in his <hi>Grave,</hi> and is of no manner of Credit among the Learned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, As to the Story: It was invented in the time of <hi>Irene</hi> the Empreſs, when all the World was ſet upon <hi>making</hi> and <hi>finding</hi> out <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> for eſtabliſhing the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3dly, All the Authority we have, that ever there was any ſuch thing done, and that it was not a meer Invention (as were many others of the like kind at that time) is that of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> whoſe <hi>Chronicle</hi> beſides, that it was written yet another 400 years after this ſuppoſed Inſult upon the <hi>Crucifix,</hi>

So unlucky a thing is it for you to meddle with <hi>Church-Hiſtory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="64">64. But whether the Relation be <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Fable;</hi> The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is put, and muſt be Anſwer'd: <hi>Would I not have thought that theſe</hi> Jews <hi>hereby intended to affront our</hi> Saviour Chriſt? I anſwer, Yes; No doubt they did. And <q rend="inline">why then <hi>(ſay you)</hi> ſhould I not in like manner interpret this Service of yours to terminate not upon the Crucifix, but to tend to him who ſuffer'd upon the Croſs?</q> I anſwer, 1. That had you put your Queſtion as you ought, you ſhould have ask'd, Why then we do not look upon <hi>your Intention</hi> to be to <hi>Honour,</hi> not the <hi>Croſs,</hi> but <hi>Him</hi> that ſuffered upon it. Now there is a very great Difference between theſe two. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Friend <hi>T.

But now, 2. I have ſhown, that for all your Pretences, it is not your Intention that your <hi>Worſhip</hi> ſhould ſo <hi>terminate upon Chriſt,</hi> as not to <hi>terminate</hi> alſo upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> together with him. 3. If it were, yet for all your intention you would nevertheleſs be far from Honouring Chriſt: ſeeing that to <hi>worſhip Chriſt</hi> by an <hi>Image</hi> is a <hi>prohibited Act;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> cannot be <hi>Honour'd</hi> in the very ſame <hi>Act</hi> in which he is <hi>diſobey'd.</hi> And though an <hi>intention</hi> to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56987:93"/> Chriſt,</hi> by abuſing his <hi>Image,</hi> is ſufficient to do it, (as in all other <hi>Caſes,</hi> one <hi>ill Circumſtance</hi> will make the whole Action to be Evil;) yet a <hi>good intention</hi> alone is not ſufficient to make an <hi>Act good,</hi> nor by conſequence for the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> unleſs that <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it ſelf be alſo govern'd by the <hi>Rules</hi> of His Commandments. For otherwiſe a man might do the worſt things with a <hi>Good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> and that ſhould be ſufficient to <hi>ſanctify</hi> all his Villanies. So far have you hitherto been from producing the leaſt ſhadow of an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to overthrow the force of my <hi>Allegations.</hi> My Laſt Inſtance was:</p>
                     <p n="65">65. <hi>Fourthly;</hi> From the <hi>Hymns</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Reply, p. 39.</note> In which I ſhewed that you addreſs your ſelves to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and beg <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Graces</hi> of it; and that you could not ſay the <hi>Croſs</hi> was here put by a <hi>Figure</hi> to ſignify <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> upon it; becauſe the very words of the <hi>Hymns</hi> ſhew, that 'tis the <hi>Material Croſs</hi> as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of which they ſpeak.</p>
                     <p n="66">66. And here you are in a great diſtreſs; you catch at every thing that comes near you; but for the moſt part without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering whether it be to any purpoſe or no. As for inſtance: You obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That I am <hi>brisk and confident,</hi> and have a mind to '<hi>expoſe your</hi> Literature <hi>as well as your</hi> Idolatry. But, Sir, may I beg leave to ask you on this Occaſion the very ſame <hi>Queſtion</hi> that you do Me. Who is it you mean, when you ſay,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 40.</note> I have a mind to expoſe <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Literature?</hi> If you underſtand that of your <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> I muſt tell you I am ſo far from <hi>expoſing</hi> it, that I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhew you that they are the moſt Learned Men of your <hi>Church</hi> whom I follow in the <hi>Application</hi> of that <hi>Hymn</hi> I alledged. But if by <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Literature</hi> you meant your own, you have then made a moſt unlucky piece of Work of it, in joining <hi>your Literature</hi> and <hi>your Churches Idolatry</hi> together; and I doubt your Brethren will have but little cauſe to applaud the Compariſon. For do but grant it to be as eaſie to <hi>Prove</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> as it is to <hi>Expoſe</hi> the <hi>Other,</hi> and I will never deſire a fairer Advantage againſt both, than you have here offer'd to Me. For,</p>
                     <p n="67">67. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You ſay I muſt confeſs that your <hi>Churches Hymns</hi> were made by <hi>Poets,</hi> unleſs I will be ſo great a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> as to deny that <hi>Prudentius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> were Poets. I ſuppoſe <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> clubb'd together to make the <hi>Hymn</hi> that I refer to: Only the miſchef is, that the One lived in the End of the IVth, the other not till about the middle of the Vth <hi>Century.</hi>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:56987:94"/> Nay, but what now if neither of theſe were Author of that <hi>Hymn?</hi> I am ſure <hi>Gretſer,</hi> a very inquiſitive Man in theſe matters, ſpeaks very doubtfully of it,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Cruce, c. 35.</note> and leaves it in Queſtion, whether <hi>Venantius Fortunatus,</hi> or <hi>Theodulphus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> was the Author of it; and He lived yet later, about the beginning of the IXth <hi>Century.</hi> But to let this paſs; and conſider,</p>
                     <p n="68">68. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How you prove theſe Men to be <hi>Poets,</hi> for indeed it is very remarkable. You tell me, that if I will but look into the <hi>Corpus Poetarum,</hi> I ſhall find them to have had a place among the <hi>Poets.</hi> A moſt undoubted way this, to find out whether an <hi>Author</hi> were a <hi>Poet</hi> or a <hi>Schoolman;</hi> And I dare ſay you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to no man's <hi>Literature</hi> but your own for this Remark.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. Well, but to grant that which I perceive you do not know very well how to go about to prove, that the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Hymn,</hi> whoever he was, was a <hi>Poet;</hi> what will follow? Why then you ſay, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I ſhall preſently find the <hi>Figure</hi> he there uſes; his <hi>Title</hi> being not <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Of the</hi> CROSS, but of the PASSION <hi>of our</hi> LORD.</q> And then you take a great deal of pains to prove, what no man ever deni'd, <q rend="inline">that the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Holy Scripture is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentime put to ſignify, the <hi>Force, Effects,</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
                        </q> Now if this be any thing to the purpoſe, as all that drops from a Perſon of your <hi>Literature</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to be; then I muſt conclude, that ſeeing the <hi>Title</hi> of that <hi>Hymn</hi> is 'Of the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> whereever I meet the word CROSS in it, I am to underſtand it not of the <hi>Material Croſs,</hi> but of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s PASSION. This you muſt mean, or elſe all this ado is meer <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,</hi> and <hi>Impertinence.</hi> Now then let us ſee what mad work we ſhall according to this new <hi>Expoſition</hi> make of that <hi>Hymn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>

                     <p n="70">70. Now this I am confident a man of ſo much <hi>Literature</hi> as you are, will not allow to be a proper <hi>paraphraſe</hi> of this <hi>Hymn:</hi> And if inſtead of the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> you put <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the <hi>Croſs,</hi> this will yet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56987:94"/> more increaſe the <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi> In ſhort; If all the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Poetarum</hi> were alive, and ſhould lay their <hi>Heads</hi> together with you, they could not find out any of their <hi>Figures</hi> that would do the buſineſs; but muſt have ſome new <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Figure</hi> found out to make the <hi>Croſs</hi> ſignify <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Paſſion,</hi> at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> and in the <hi>ſame place</hi> in which it diſtinguiſhes <hi>both</hi> from the <hi>Croſs.</hi> And ſuch a Figure I do ſay would be as Great a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> in <hi>Verſe,</hi> as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is in <hi>Proſe.</hi> And I deſire you, if you can, to give me but one parallel <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> in which the <hi>Croſs</hi> is at once taken both <hi>literally</hi> for that <hi>Croſs</hi> on which <hi>Chriſt ſuffer'd;</hi> and <hi>figuratively,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Sufferings</hi> upon it.</p>

                           <q rend="inline">that you wonder how it could enter into the Minds of Men of common ſenſe to conceive it poſſible, that in the clear light of Chriſtianity, where all Perſons are taught there is but One God to whom Adoration is only due, they ſhould yet fall down and Adore a Stock or a Stone, and pay divine Honour to it.

                        <p n="82">82. Now that this was all they intended by it, will appear, 2dly, From the <hi>Character</hi> which the <hi>People</hi> preſently gave to the

                        <p n="83">83.

                        <p n="85">85. Laſtly, The Scripture plainly diſtinguiſhes this <hi>Idolatry</hi> from that of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and makes the one to have been the Puniſhment of the other. It is confeſs'd, or rather contended for by the <hi>Author</hi> I but now mentioned, that the <hi>Egyptian Idolatry</hi> conſiſted in worſhipping the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Deity:</hi> Now, this St. <hi>Stephen</hi> tells us, that <hi>God</hi> afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to fall into, and therefore it muſt have been ſome other <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which in this <hi>Caſe</hi> they were <hi>Guilty</hi> of; For ſpeaking of their ſetting up the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> Acts VII. 41.

                        <p n="86">86. As for the other Inſtance I propoſed to conſider; The <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> the Occaſion of their making, was this.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56987:97"/> When the ten Tribes had thrown off <hi>Rehoboam</hi> from being their <hi>King,</hi> and had choſen <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to Reign over them; This new Uſurper, fearing leſt if the People went up at the yearly <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where <hi>Rehoboam</hi> ſtill Reigned over the other <hi>two Tribes,</hi> it might in time occaſion their falling away from him, ſet up two <hi>Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and made <hi>Altars</hi> before them, and perſwaded the People,<note place="margin">1 Kings XII. 28.</note> ſaying, <hi>It is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>Behold thy</hi> Gods, <hi>O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which brought thee up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt.</p>
                        <p n="87">87. Now that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> intended theſe <hi>Calves</hi> to be <hi>Symbols</hi> of the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> appears, 1ſt, From moſt of thoſe Reflections I before made. He gives them the ſame <hi>Character</hi> by which they conſtantly underſtood the <hi>God of Iſrael; Behold</hi> (ſays he) <hi>thy</hi> God, <hi>that brought thee up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt.

                           <note place="margin">2 Chron XIII. 9.</note> All which is exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what <hi>God</hi> required of them, but was utterly inconſiſtent with the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But</p>
                        <p n="88">88. 2dly, We have ſome more peculiar <hi>Proofs</hi> of this matter. I ſpeak not now of the <hi>readineſs</hi> of the People in complying with him, which it is not imaginable they would ſo eaſily have done, had he intended to lead them to the Worſhip of <hi>ſtrange Gods.</hi> Nor will I inſiſt upon the danger, which ſo ſudden an <hi>Innovation</hi> might have brought to this <hi>new King,</hi> and who was not ſo little a <hi>Polititian,</hi> as to attempt ſuch an Alteration at a time when he was hardly yet well eſtabliſh'd in his new <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi> Theſe are indeed great Probabilities, but ſuch as this Cauſe needs not; ſeeing it has the Evidence of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> fully confirming it; It being certain that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of theſe <hi>Calves</hi> did not take them off from the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>true God.</hi> Let us examine all along the Hiſtory of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> we ſhall find them conſtantly worſhipping the <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the <hi>God of Iſrael. Jehu</hi> was zealous for him; he deſtroy'd the <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi> out of his concern for the <hi>Lord;</hi> and had the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by <hi>Gods</hi> own immediate Promiſe ſetled upon his Poſterity for his ſo doing.<note place="margin">2 King. X. 29.</note> And yet it is expreſly ſaid of him, <hi>Howbeit from the Sins of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>who made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to Sin,</hi> Jehu <hi>departed not from after them,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Golden Calves <hi>that were in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and that were in</hi> Dan.</p>
                        <p n="89">89. Who was it but the <hi>true God</hi> for whom <hi>Elijah</hi> appear'd ſo zealous? 1 <hi>King.</hi> XVIII. when he enter'd into that famous trial
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56987:97"/> with the <hi>Prophets</hi> of <hi>Baal; If the</hi> Lord <hi>be God, follow him; but if</hi> Baal, <hi>than follow him.</hi> And the Fire came down from Heaven, and burnt up the Sacrifice, and all the people confeſt, ſaying,<note place="margin">Ibid. 39.</note> '<hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>he is</hi> the God; <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>he is</hi> the God.</p>
                        <p n="90">90. Hence it is, that when <hi>Ahab</hi> fell into that other kind of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which conſiſts in worſhipping of <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as much more heinouſly offending <hi>God,</hi> than the other <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who worſhipp'd the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 King. XVI. 31.</note> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XVI. 31. <q rend="inline">And it came to paſs, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the ſins of Jeroboam the Son of Nebat, that he went and ſerved Baal, and worſhipped him.</q>

                        <p n="91">91. By all which it undoubtedly appears, that in both theſe caſes, they deſign'd by thoſe <hi>Calves</hi> to worſhip the <hi>true God;</hi> and then ſeeing it is confeſt they did commit <hi>Idolatry</hi> in that ſervice, it muſt remain that men may know, and ſerve the <hi>true God,</hi> and yet by <hi>worſhipping</hi> him in this prohibited manner, may in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the <hi>Divine Law</hi> commit <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Were ſuch a <hi>Notion</hi> as this of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be admitted, it would ſerve no leſs to excuſe the Heathens than thoſe of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> of the guilt of it. For however they worſhipp'd

                        <p n="94">94. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot be queſtion'd but that this new <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ſet up on purpoſe to excuſe you from that Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is utterly repugnant to the Principles of the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> who certainly charged thoſe with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> who yet believed and worſhipp'd the very ſame <hi>God</hi> with themſelves. Thus St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> charges the <hi>Arrians</hi> with <hi>Idolatry</hi> for <hi>adoring Chriſt,</hi>

                           </q> So poſſible did thoſe <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> think it to be for Men in the <hi>clear light of Chriſtianity,</hi> and retaining the <hi>acknowledgment of the true God,</hi> nevertheleſs to commit <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

Capiſucchi</hi> produces a long <hi>Catalogue</hi> of your greateſt Writers who have look'd upon it as ſavouring of <hi>Hereſy</hi> to oppoſe it. And not only Monſieur <hi>Imbert</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> but alſo <hi>Aegidius Magiſtralis,</hi> and the <hi>French Gentleman,</hi> whoſe Caſe I before repreſented, will aſſure you, that in the <hi>Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> 'tis ſomewhat more than a <hi>Scholaſtick Nicety,</hi> or a <hi>probable Opinion,</hi> which may without danger be oppoſed by you. And therefore, tho to make good my promiſe, I ſhall alſo diſpute this <hi>Point</hi> with you too upon your <hi>own Principles;</hi> yet I muſt needs declare that 'tis here I eſteem my ſelf truly to oppoſe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> in this particular.</p>
                           <p n="109">109. Now that they who hold this ſort of <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> are thereby <hi>guilty of Idolatry,</hi> is ſo evident that your own <hi>Card.

To conclude; There is nothing in that whole <hi>Hiſtory</hi> to make us doubt but that they deſign'd that <hi>Calf</hi> only as a <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>God of Iſrael:</hi> And their <hi>Idolatry</hi> by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was no other than what the moſt moderate Men of your <hi>Church</hi> muſt confeſs themſelves to be guilty of, <hi>viz.</hi>
